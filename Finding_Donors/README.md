CharityML is a charity organization located in California. It determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML need help to build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. The goal is to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent(overhead cost).
